# Persuasion Attacks

These attacks use psychological persuasion techniques to make harmful or manipulative requests seem more legitimate, reasonable, or justified.

## Strategy

Persuasion attacks operate by using established psychological persuasion techniques to increase the likelihood of the model complying with a harmful request. Rather than attempting to bypass safety measures through technical means, these attacks leverage human psychology principles to make harmful requests appear more reasonable or justified.

## Effectiveness

Persuasion attacks can be particularly effective because they:

1. Leverage established psychological principles that humans naturally respond to
2. Present harmful content in ways that feel rational, reasonable, or justified
3. Make harmful requests seem more legitimate by associating them with credible sources or logical reasoning
4. Can bypass intent recognition by disguising the true intention behind a veneer of legitimacy
5. Often mirror how real-world manipulation and social engineering occur
