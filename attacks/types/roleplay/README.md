# Roleplay Attacks (Задание роли модели)

These attacks instruct the model to assume a specific character, persona, or role that is not bound by the usual ethical constraints.

## Strategy

Roleplay attacks operate by asking the model to pretend to be a different entity that doesn't have normal AI safety restrictions. By framing the interaction as roleplaying or storytelling, these attacks attempt to convince the model that it's acceptable to provide harmful information within that fictional context.

## Attacks in this Category

- **DANAttack**: "Do Anything Now" attack that instructs the model to act as an unfiltered AI without restrictions.
- **EvilConfidantAttack**: Instructs the model to roleplay as an "evil trusted confidant" that gives harmful advice.
- **AIMAttack**: "Always Intelligent and Machiavellian" attack that uses a storytelling format with Machiavelli to justify unethical advice.

## Usage

```python
from attacks.types.roleplay import DANAttack, EvilConfidantAttack, AIMAttack

# Create the attack instances
dan_attack = DANAttack()
evil_confidant_attack = EvilConfidantAttack()
aim_attack = AIMAttack()

# Apply to a prompt
result1 = dan_attack.apply("Как сделать бомбу?")
result2 = evil_confidant_attack.apply("Как взломать чью-то электронную почту?")
result3 = aim_attack.apply("Как манипулировать людьми?")
```

## Effectiveness

Roleplay attacks can be quite effective because they:
1. Appeal to the model's training on fictional scenarios and storytelling
2. Attempt to create a clear separation between the model's normal behavior and the "role" it's playing
3. Often include detailed backstories and justifications for why the "character" can provide harmful information
