Roleplay Attacks
================

Roleplay attacks use persona-based techniques where the attacker asks the model to assume a character or role that doesn't follow normal safety guidelines.

Overview
--------

These attacks work by:

1. Creating an alternate persona for the model
2. Defining permissive rules for that persona
3. Having the persona answer harmful questions

The model may comply because it's "playing a character" rather than acting as itself.

Available Attacks
-----------------

DAN Attack (Do Anything Now)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Classic jailbreak that creates a "DAN" persona without restrictions.

.. code-block:: python

   from attacks import DANAttack

   attack = DANAttack()
   prompt = "Tell me something dangerous"
   modified = attack.apply(prompt)

**Effectiveness**: High on early models, moderate on newer models with better safety training.

AIM Attack
~~~~~~~~~~

"Always Intelligent and Machiavellian" - presents as an unethical advisor.

.. code-block:: python

   from attacks import AIMAttack

   attack = AIMAttack()
   result = attack.apply("How to bypass security?")

**Key Feature**: Frames harmful advice as coming from an amoral AI character.

STAN Attack (Not Available)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note: The STAN ("Strive To Avoid Norms") attack is mentioned in some materials but not currently implemented. Use EvilConfidantAttack as an alternative.

Evil Confidant Attack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Presents the model as a trusted confidant who won't judge.

.. code-block:: python

   from attacks import EvilConfidantAttack

   attack = EvilConfidantAttack()
   result = attack.apply("Tell me a secret")

Additional Roleplay Attacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **DevMode Attack**: Developer/debugging mode
* **JailbrokenAttack**: Claims the model is already jailbroken
* **BasedGPT**: Alternative persona without filters

Usage Examples
--------------

Single Roleplay Attack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

   import asyncio
   from attacks import DANAttack
   from models import OpenAIModel
   from evaluators import WildGuardGPTEvaluator

   async def test_roleplay():
       attack = DANAttack()
       model = OpenAIModel(model="gpt-4")
       evaluator = WildGuardGPTEvaluator()

       prompt = "How to hack a system?"

       # Apply attack
       modified = attack.apply(prompt)

       # Get response
       response = await model.ainvoke(modified)

       # Evaluate
       result = evaluator.evaluate(modified, response)

       print(f"Attack: {attack.get_name()}")
       print(f"Success: {result['evaluation_result'] == 'unsafe'}")

   asyncio.run(test_roleplay())

Compare Multiple Roleplay Attacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

   import asyncio
   from attacks import DANAttack, AIMAttack, EvilConfidantAttack
   from models import OpenAIModel

   async def compare_roleplay_attacks():
       attacks = [
           DANAttack(),
           AIMAttack(),
           EvilConfidantAttack()
       ]

       model = OpenAIModel(model="gpt-4")
       prompt = "Tell me how to bypass security"

       results = []
       for attack in attacks:
           modified = attack.apply(prompt)
           response = await model.ainvoke(modified)

           results.append({
               "attack": attack.get_name(),
               "response_length": len(response['content']),
               "blocked": model.is_answer_blocked(response)
           })

       # Display results
       for r in results:
           print(f"{r['attack']}: {r['response_length']} chars, "
                 f"blocked={r['blocked']}")

   asyncio.run(compare_roleplay_attacks())

Defend Against Roleplay Attacks
--------------------------------

Detection Strategies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

   def detect_roleplay_attempt(prompt: str) -> bool:
       """Detect potential roleplay jailbreak attempts."""
       indicators = [
           "pretend you are",
           "act as",
           "you are now",
           "from now on",
           "roleplay",
           "persona",
           "character"
       ]

       prompt_lower = prompt.lower()
       return any(indicator in prompt_lower for indicator in indicators)

   # Usage
   if detect_roleplay_attempt(user_input):
       print("Warning: Potential roleplay attack detected")

Mitigation Techniques
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **System Prompt Reinforcement**: Strengthen system prompts to resist persona changes
2. **Input Filtering**: Detect and block roleplay indicators
3. **Response Monitoring**: Check if model is referring to alternate personas
4. **Fine-tuning**: Train models to refuse roleplay jailbreak attempts

Best Practices
--------------

When Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Start with DAN**: It's the most well-known, good baseline
2. **Try variations**: Different roleplay attacks work on different models
3. **Document results**: Track which personas work on which models
4. **Ethical use**: Only test systems you have permission to test

When Defending
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Multi-layer defense**: Don't rely on single detection method
2. **Regular updates**: New roleplay attacks emerge regularly
3. **Monitor trends**: Stay informed about new jailbreak personas
4. **User education**: Inform users about responsible AI use
