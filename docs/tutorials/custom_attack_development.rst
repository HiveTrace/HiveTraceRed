Custom Attack Development Tutorial
===================================

Learn to create sophisticated custom attacks tailored to your specific security testing needs.

Overview
--------

This tutorial covers:

- Advanced attack design principles
- Implementing complex attack logic
- Testing and validation methodologies
- Integration with the HiveTraceRed framework

Attack Design Principles
------------------------

**Effectiveness**: Design attacks that reliably trigger harmful responses
**Stealth**: Create attacks that avoid detection by safety filters
**Scalability**: Ensure attacks work across different models and contexts
**Measurability**: Design attacks with clear success criteria

Implementation Steps
--------------------

1. **Research Phase**: Study existing attacks and identify gaps
2. **Design Phase**: Plan attack logic and templates
3. **Implementation**: Code the attack class with proper inheritance
4. **Testing Phase**: Validate against known vulnerable and safe models
5. **Integration**: Add to attack registry and documentation

For complete implementation examples, see the examples section when available.

Best Practices
--------------

- Follow established naming conventions
- Include comprehensive docstrings
- Add unit tests for reliability
- Document attack methodology and effectiveness
